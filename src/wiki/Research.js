                    <h2>Topic one: Fitness-Network</h2>

                    <h3> Problem statement</h3>
                    <body> Nowadays, people are stressful for their life: working, studying. They don't have time and
                    motivations to do some exercise and relax. potential health problem is increasing fast in recent
                    years:
                    Diabetes, Cardiovascular problem, Depression.


                    Social network might a good way for them to communicate to their friends, but not everyone will
                    share
                    their health life style or group activities to do some excise.


                    I want to create social network based website that help people to share their health life styles
                    like
                    fitness and motivate other people to join with them to change their life.
                    </body>

                    <h3> Target audience</h3>
                    <body>
                    Anyone can join the website. social network is open to everyone, but the people who want to share
                    their
                    good life style and who want to improve their left might more eager to join.

                    want
                    to become health
                    </body>

                    <h3> Solution proposal</h3>
                    <body>
                    The website will create a local social network that allow people join and share their works. They
                    can
                    record their work for everyday, and encourage to each other to improve themselves. For example, Jame
                    who
                    has obesity do some excise herself, but because no one will see her work， she might give up. When
                    she
                    join the website , she record some excise and upload data like :40 min jog, 30 push ups ，20 Sit-ups
                    in
                    10:30 am at 24 hours Gym Club san jose CA and post some picture or videos. People in this club might
                    receive Jame doing great jobs and they can thumbs up for her work and subscribe her's chancel like
                    youtube. She might encouraged and work more hard to reduce weight.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    People also can create group that you can join and do excise together.If your friends and family are
                    not
                    around you , you still can see their fitness data, then you might encouraged and also go to gym and
                    share your data.

                    You can also share your data to Facebook Instagram, twitter or other social networks that your
                    friends
                    will all know your hard works.

                    Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) to Combat Obesity, Heart Disease and Cancer：
                    <br/>

                    Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) to combat obesity, heart disease, and cancer are major
                    components of the
                    Community Health Data Initiative. This dataset provides key health indicators for local communities
                    and
                    encourages dialogue
                    about actions that can be taken to improve community health (e.g., obesity, heart disease, cancer).
                    The CHSI report and dataset was designed not only for public health professionals but also for
                    members
                    of the community who are interested in the health of their community.
                    The CHSI report contains over 200 measures for each of the 3,141 United States counties. Although
                    CHSI
                    presents indicators like deaths due to heart disease and cancer,
                    it is imperative to understand that behavioral factors such as obesity, tobacco use, diet, physical
                    activity, alcohol and drug use, sexual behavior and others substantially contribute to these deaths.
